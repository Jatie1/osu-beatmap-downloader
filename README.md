osu! Beatmap Downloader
=====

Beatmap downloader programmed in Java for the rhythm game osu!.

Has the ability to download all ranked beatmaps for either a single year, or within a given year range, and will scan the maps you already have to eliminate duplicate downloads.

Will soon have the ability to download DMCA'd maps, once chimu.moe get their shit together.

Created as a personal project to improve my coding skills, don't expect quality code.
